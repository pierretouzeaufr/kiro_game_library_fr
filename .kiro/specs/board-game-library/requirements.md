# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Board Game Library Management System is a Golang-based application designed to manage a collection of board games with user borrowing capabilities. The system will track game inventory, user borrowing history, due dates, and provide alerts for overdue items. It features a responsive web interface and uses SQLite for local data storage, making it suitable for small to medium-sized game libraries or personal collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a user account with unique identifier, name, email, and registration date
2. WHEN viewing a user profile THEN the system SHALL display current borrowed items, borrowing history, and any overdue items
3. WHEN a user borrows an item THEN the system SHALL record the borrowing date, due date, and associate it with the user account
4. WHEN a user returns an item THEN the system SHALL update the borrowing record with return date and make the item available
5. IF a user has overdue items THEN the system SHALL prevent new borrowing until items are returned

### Requirement 2: Item Management

4. WHEN a game is returned THEN the system SHALL update the status to "available" and record return date
5. WHEN searching for games THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by name, availability status, and category

### Requirement 3: Alert System

**User Story:** As a library administrator, I want to receive alerts for overdue items, so that I can follow up with users who haven't returned games on time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item becomes overdue THEN the system SHALL generate an alert with user details and overdue duration
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all overdue items with borrower information
3. WHEN an overdue item is returned THEN the system SHALL automatically clear the associated alert
4. WHEN checking daily THEN the system SHALL identify items that will be due within 2 days and create reminder alerts
5. IF multiple items are overdue for the same user THEN the system SHALL group alerts by user for easier management

### Requirement 4: User Interface

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want a simple and responsive interface, so that I can easily manage the library from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear menu options for users, games, and alerts
3. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and confirmation messages
4. WHEN viewing data tables THEN the system SHALL support sorting, filtering, and pagination for large datasets
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and intuitive navigation patterns

### Requirement 5: Data Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable local data storage, so that the library data is preserved and easily accessible without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a SQLite database with required tables and indexes
2. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL ensure ACID compliance for all database transactions
3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL safely close database connections and preserve data integrity
4. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks
5. IF the database file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 6: Borrowing Workflow

**User Story:** As a library user, I want a streamlined borrowing and return process, so that I can quickly check out and return games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN borrowing a game THEN the system SHALL verify game availability and user eligibility
2. WHEN setting due dates THEN the system SHALL default to 14 days from borrowing date but allow administrator override
3. WHEN processing returns THEN the system SHALL calculate any late fees or penalties based on overdue duration
